This is the simple android currency converter app that is built by using MVC model.
View -> something that is visible for the user
	- Specifically for this app, an .xml file that contain different widgets like buttons, textView and so on.
Model -> something that contain the design of the classes or data used (storage of the data)
	- MainActivity.java class contains the model of the application
	 and also methods can be the models since they define the structures of the class.
Controller -> Controls the features and manages the communication between model and views
